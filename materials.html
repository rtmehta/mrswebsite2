<h3>Check out some of the awesome developments that are happening in the world of materials! </h3>
<h4>Want some peace and quiet? Scientists have found a new way to deliver just that!
<p>Researchers at Boston University have developed a metamaterial, or material engineered to have specific properties not found naturally, that blocks more than 90% of sound.
Unlike current sound barriers, which capture sound, this new material reflects sound while still allowing air to pass through. 
As a result, this new design has applications in normally loud environments where airflow is critical - jet engines, air conditioning, and more.
It is also lightweight and cheaper to manufacture, so the possibilities are endless! </p>

<h4>Our next electricity generator: Snow! </h4>
<p>UCLA researchers have developed a falling snow triboelectric generator, which produces charge through static electricity. Snow, which is positively charged, is combined with silicon to collect the charge produced when two meet.  
This could prove extremely useful for solar panels, which are normally rendered useless when covered in snow. Created using 3D printing, the device is small, inexpensive, and flexible, leading to many potential applications.

<!-- AWESOME MATERIAL OF THE WEEK
<h2>Awesome Material of the Week: Dilatants!</h2>
<p>Ever mix cornstarch and water and get that goopy stuff that gets hard whenever you slam a spoon against it? You throw it against walls and it thumps, but you can pour it like a liquid? Well, this is actually a class of materials called "dilatants." </p>
<h4>What's a dilatant?</h4>
<p>Diltants, also called shear-thickening fluids, are a subcategory of a group of materials called non-newtonian fluids. Really, that's just the name they picked out for fluids that don't have a constant viscosity; when you push it or try to mess with it, it gets either more "liquidy" or more hard. Dilatants are materials that get much harder to move through the more force you exert on it.</p>
<h4>No way, how's it do that?</h4>
<p>Yeah, I'm pretty good at cheesy subheaders. Well, really dilatants aren't <i>just</i> a fluid, they're actually solid particles floating in a liquid, aka a colloid. The solid particles can stick together but, naturally, they'd rather just repel each other. When something hits the fluid surface, it puts energy into the liquid which causes the particles to overcome their repulsions and forces them to stick to each other. But, without that energy, the particles go back to they're repelling state. If you're having trouble visuallizing all of this, just think of sand as a dilatant. When you walk slowly across a sandy beach, you sink in a little bit and it's really hard to move, but if you start running, it pushes back at your feet hard, almost like a compacted solid. When you hold it in your hand, it just flows through, but when you squeeze it, it becomes hard. </p>

Heard enough about how cool this stuff is?

That's it! See how easy that was? Now you have a dilatant. This version doesn't really serve that much practical purpose, but scientists are using similar stuff to make a plethora of interesting things. One of its applications is for body armor. A big problem for police and soldiers is that the more protective the armor is, the less mobile the wearer. But a dilatant filled armor wouldn't have this problem because with small movements, the armor would be fluid but as soon as it is hit by a projectile, the armor would harden and stop the projectile before hitting the wearer. Here's a video where some developers are working on just such a vest.

Now then, the question is what do you do now that you have some dilatant in a baggy? All kinds of stuff. Be creative. You could put it on top of a speaker and play music and watch it react to pulses of pressure from the speaker...like this guy.

<h3> New Hybrid Material Absorbs ALL Colors of the Spectrum </h3>
<h4> You mean it didn't before?! </h4>
So, I always assumed that because solar panels were black, they absorbed all colors of the visible spectrum. Apparently, I was wrong...until NOW!!! Ohio State University, with funding from the NSF, were able to create a new type of material hybrid that is "able to absorb the energy of all sunlight." To my knowledge, I also assumed there were ultraviolet and infrared radiation from the sun buuut, I didn't write the article.
<h5>How does it do that?!</h5>
Well,

<h3> Self-healing Polymer Acts Like Human Skin </h3>
<img src="http://www.terradaily.com/images/self-healing-polymer-skin-bg.jpg" align="right">
<h4> The sight of blood makes me nauseated... </h4>
<p> University of Illinois material scientists developed a self-healing polymer that uses a vascular network to heal cracks. Inlaid throughout the polymer is a network of capillaries which are filled with a "healing agent" and the surface of the material is coated with a catalyst. </p>
<h5> What it does. </h5>
<p> So let's say you've got a GI Joe (or GI Jane for the ladies) made of this stuff and along comes Shredder (yes, shredder from the Ninja Turtles. No one ever had the bad guys AND the good guys from the same line of toys.) who decides to swipe our GI hero with a kitchen knife. Oh no! GI Joe/Jane has a real cut. Well here's the cool part. The kitchen knife pushes some of the surface catalyst (called Grubbs' catalyst) into the crack and a capillary is cut which causes healing agent to gush into the gash, react with the catalyst, and form a hardened surface within 10 hours. Nancy Sottos, author of the research, says that it doesn't even need to take 10 hours it's just that it is a much cleaner harder heal. </p>
<h5> How do they make that? </h5>
<p> While being set, scientist push waxy tubes throughout the polymer. After the polymer is hard, they melt the waxy tubes and drain them out leaving a series of tunnels to fill with the heaing agent. </p>
<h5> Why we're screwed </h5>
<p> In the year 2099, when robot soldiers are fighting wars for us (giant robot GI Joes and Janes), we'll have to deal with them becoming self-aware and, with self-healing materials stronger, faster, and better than ever, we'll be enslaved and/or killed. Hey, at least by 2099 we won't be alive anyway. </p>

<h3> Self-healing Rubber "Miracle" </h3>
<object width="250" align="right"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bho1-R5heFc" ></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Bho1-R5heFc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="250"></embed></object>
<h4> *Tee Hee Hee*...Rubber Made of...Pee. </h4>
<p> So in the self-healing material side of research, here's one of great interest. It's a rubber made of urea and vegetable oil. See how easy science can be? Here's the idea: regular rubber is a polymer, like plastic. It's a so called "macromolecule" made of long repeating groups, connected through covalent bonds that work kind of like a spring; the groups are connected to one another in a zig zag. When you stretch the rubber, the bonds straighten out but really want to return to their nice comfortable zig zag and so that's what they do. Here's the thing: if you cut it, you cut bonds which can't attach again. </4>
<h5> Pee Rubber to the Rescue! </h5>
<p> Enter our new hero, Self-healing Rubber. Similar to regular rubber, this stuff attaches groups as long chains BUT the major difference here is that they use hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds, as those of you who haven't taken Chem 20A may not know, are the bonds that form from molecules that have a dipole moment (have one side that's kinda '+' and one side that's kinda '-' like a magnet) coming into contact and attracting each other (again, like a magnet). So if a strip of this stuff is cut or ripped apart, you just need to put it back together again and it's nearly as good as new. Watch the French scientists who made it show it off in this video (courtesy of New Scientist). They're already manufacturing a bunch of this stuff to test in sealants so look forward to seeing this on an infomercial in the near future! </p>

<h3> E. Coli Evolved to Make Plastic! </h3>

<h4> Tree Huggers Rejoice! </h4>
<p> Feel all warm and fuzzy when you hear news about greener technology? Get the tinglies when you hear the words "solar power?" Go on early morning walks so that no one will see you hug a tree? I know I enjoy all of these things and I sure as heck enjoyed this article.</p>
<p>We have all used a product of butanediol (BDO). It is used to make spandex, polyurethanes, and plastics used in electronics and automotive industries plus several others. In fact, BDO is so widely used, we consume 7-8% more of it every year. Most of you Greenies cringed when you heard plastic though because, as we all know, plastic needs oils and natural gasses for large scale production, right? Scientists at Genomatica in San Diego don't seem to think so. There, scientists have engineered e. coli bacteria to produce BDO using only sugar and water. Typically, BDO is toxic to the e. coli but those geniuses have even taken advantage of bacteria's natural evolution processes to make them resistant to BDO. In fact, says Christophe Schilling, co-founder of Genomatica:</p>
<p>"We are able to couple the growth of the organism to the production of BDO. For the bacteria to grow, they have to produce BDO."</p>
<p>Schilling claims that even if companies reduced the cost of oil by $50/barrel, their method would still give oil companies a run for their money, atrributing lower costs to the low cost of raw materials and low transportation costs. The big wigs of Genomatica claim that first of these natural production plastic plants will spring up in about a year but there are always hitches; better to expect to use your first bacteria plastic in a few years.</p>
